# PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM DEMO

This repository holds the code for the demo app made as a part of Product Recommendation System for minor project.

The app makes use of a dataset from a Kaggle competition where data about customer purchase history and the various articles/products listed on their website were provided.

Making use of different recommendation techniques, we can now find similar items to a randomly selected item as well as get recommendations for a randomly selected customer based on their purchase history.

## Replicating the app

Just clone the repository and download the requirements using the requirements.txt file and you are good to go.
